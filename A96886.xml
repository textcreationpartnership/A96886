            <title>The churches thank-offering to God her King, and the Parliament, for rich and ancient mercies; her yeares of captivity; her first yeare of iubile; that is, for the marvelous deliverances wrought with God the first wonderfull yeare (since the yeare 88) beginning at September 1640. and ending the ninth of the same moneth following: in all which time, the Lord appeared for his church, as in the dayes of old, out of the middest of the bush, so the church burn'd with fire, and was not consumed. In the preface, the thank-offering is vindicated, and set free, from all the cavills and charges against it; where also it is cleared to be, as every mans duty, so every mans purpose, to offer willingly now, who doth not make full proofe, that he falls short of pagan, papist or atheist; and is wilfully resolved to walk crosse to the most supreme law, the highest reason, and the unquestionable will of God.</title>

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Lord knowes how willingly I would have ſtepped over theſe blocks; but He knows, ſo I could not doe, and not offend the Church, and the Reader both, ſo great is the offence in the way, which by His ſtrength, I ſhall remove from before his eyes, who is not reſolved to ſhut them, that he may ſtumble with leſſe excuſe, and more impudence in a Sun-ſhine.

                  <p>It is ſaid, the People in the Country were at this point wiſe enough and provident enough. That's true, wiſe enough in their Generation, wiſer then the children of light; and provident enough too; for what? For their owne private-wealth, their particular intereſts; Take them otherwiſe and in the lumpe, and out of their owne tractes, and they have little wiſdome or providence at all. True it is, they were pinched now, and that made them looke up from the ground, wheron they are ſtill poring. They did <hi>howle,</hi> becauſe of their Task<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters, which made them looke out for helpe, and be a little more provident then ordinary. They that preſſed <hi>Ship-money,</hi> ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have their voyces; ſo they were reſolved, ſo tender they were in their owne eaſe, and where it pinched; but for the cauſe of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and His <hi>Church,</hi> it is little in their thoughts. I know the manner of men well enough, by making enquiry into mine owne heart, and the manners and cuſtomes there. As our intereſts leade us, and our relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſtand, there is the <hi>BIAS,</hi> that way we goe, and there we caſt our voyce, conſidering no more, but that he is our <hi>moſt honoured Lord and Maſter.</hi> Thanke the Country-man, who will; the <hi>Church</hi> will not, till ſhe heare of ſuch an one, who, againſt his owne intereſt, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate-wealth, and ſpeciall Relation, minded the Common-weale, and ſo caſt his voyce, She will praiſe the Lord, as vvell as ſhe can, and call upon all ſo to doe; and bleſſe His Name for His good Servants, vvhoſe voyces vvere ſent up in corners. And ſo we may count it a mercy, that ſuch a choyce was made; but for the <hi>marvellous worke,</hi> and the <hi>wonder</hi> we read it before, and this, that followes, makes it yet more wonderfull.</p>
                  <p>That vvhen the <hi>Worthies</hi> came altogether, and made a full Court, then and there, The Lord did ſo ſtirre-up their ſpirits, as that they vvere carried ſome of them above themſelves, yea, and (I appeale to themſelves) againſt themſelves: I meane, againſt vvhat they thought and intended, vvhen they vvere entring the doores of the Houſe. Doubtleſſe ſo it vvas, elſe ſuch things had not bin done, as are done, had it not beene even ſo. But it is wonderfull in our eyes, for it is the Lords doing, Who when His vvorke is in hand, vvill frame and mould the ſpirits of Men, according to His good pleaſure. There is yet ſomething more in it, and greatly to be obſerved, that the Lord ſent forth a <hi>dry wind,</hi> which ſifted and ſifted this Court; now one was blown away, anon another: Now this man vvent his way, and the other did flee away.

                  <p>Was that the clearing of <hi>Davids</hi> innocency? Yes, none like that: <hi>David</hi> behaved himſelfe wiſely, and God was with him; he could <hi>ſtrengthen his hand in God;</hi> he could <hi>encourage himſelfe in the Lord his God</hi>

                  <p>God may <hi>ſhine</hi> upon the Councels of the wicked, and croſſe the proceedings of the juſt commanded and warranted from His owne Mouth.

                  <p>But here is the point we drive unto; vvhen Deliverances come-in unto His people with the ſeale and impreſſion of the wiſdome and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of God upon them, this is ever, becauſe they are His people; He delights in them; there is innocency in their hearts, and their hands are pure from that great evill ſuggeſted againſt them. Such Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the Lord wrought for <hi>David,</hi> They had the impreſſe of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighties hand upon them. <hi>Saul</hi> hunted him like a Partridge: God would not deliver him into his hands; Hee reſcued him here and there and every where. It had not beene ſo, if innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy had not beene found in his hands, and integrity in his heart towards <hi>Saul,</hi> his peace and dignity, for he was the Lords an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted. The Text is plaine, it needs not my Comment, but I'le apply it comparing the Salvations then and now together; for their accuſation is the ſame; crimes objected the ſame; their defence or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology the ſame; and God the ſame in reſcuing them, and clearing their innocency as the Noon day.</p>
